# Blocked Game Example #4

<img src="BlockedGame4.png" alt="Blocked Case" width="70%" height="70%">

1. Note that I can't move card <span style="color:red">5❤️</span> because parents 6♠️ and 6♣️ are hidden in the tableau.  Hence the <span style="color:red">A♦️</span> above it can't be moved either.
1. The <span style="color:red">5❤️</span> will never make it to the *foundation* either because the <span style="color:red">4❤️</span> is locked in column 1, row 2.
1. The <span style="color:red">Q♦️</span> can't be moved because the K♠️ and K♣️ are hidden in the *tableau*.
1. Although the A♠️ can be moved to the *tableau*, the <span style="color:red">2♦️</span> above it cannot be moved because its parents white 3s cannot be played from the waste because the white 3s' parents will not be able to moved to the 5♠️ and 5♣️ in the top row.

I.e., the first 3 *tableau* columns are stuck because the blocked cards in the first *tableau* columns: <span style="color:red">2♦️</span>, <span style="color:red">Q♦️</span>, and <span style="color:red">5❤️</span> cannot be moved regardless of what happens in the remaining *tableau* columns 4 through 7.

This game cannot be solved.
