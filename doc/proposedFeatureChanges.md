# Proposed Feature Changes TODO

## First generation of changes

### Have stock turn over 1 card instead of 3

This will bring this game into closer alignment with my objectives of teaching this program how to play Solitaire w/o having to worry about the 3-card turn.

Ultimately, I simply want to display all the of the cards in the *waste*, and not have a *stock* at all.

### Show unrevealed cards in the tableau

They should show their values but also reveal that they cannot be accessed them.

## Second generation of changes TODO

### First, display all the cards in the waste as wished for above.

### Other TODO
